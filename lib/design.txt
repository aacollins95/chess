Squares
  unicode 3x3 chars
  MAybe we should just be alternating Whtie square and black square
  every other is alternate color
  highlight is unicode double bar
  should every square have a piece (inlcuding a 'null' piece), or should
  only occupied sqaures have a piece (each square has an occupied? var)
  can NOT draw itself
  Only occupied squares will have a piece (allows a list of pieces)
  Squares have a position (X,Y) ([0-7],[0-7])
  some sort of get_neighbors, or advance combination
  dir != pos!!!!


Board
  8x8 grid of squares
  creates pieces for each player
  |

TO FIX
  make input less naive (done)
  make pawns move two on first turn (done)
  pawns capture diagonally
  black pawns should move down(done)
  you can pick pieces that can't move,unending loop
  checkmate wont trigger if king can move to occupied square

TO DO
  Save functionality
    opening screen
    maybe get_input should be more modular, (allow save and return)
  Check check/mate
    check: king_pos in list of other players possible moves (done)
    mate: king_moves all in other players possible moves
